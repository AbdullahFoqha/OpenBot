/**
 * The three facts about the adapter that a type checker cannot settle, asserted with no network.
 *
 * {@link buildComposioClient} takes the vendor OBJECT rather than an API key, and that is the whole
 * reason this file can exist: every test below hands it a literal whose methods record what they
 * were asked and answer from memory, so the adapter's own decisions are what is under test and
 * nothing here dials Composio. A `createComposioClient` that only took a key would have made this
 * file either a live test or no test at all.
 *
 * WHAT IS WORTH ASSERTING IS WHAT IS EASY TO GET SILENTLY WRONG. The mapping of the vendor's fields
 * onto ours is one such thing — a listing that omitted its limit, or a catalogue row that read the
 * wrong key for an action count, both answer plausibly and both are wrong in a way no exception
 * reports. The refusal is the other: it is the one place this adapter is required to NOT make a
 * vendor call, and an implementation that forwarded a mismatch would pass every test that only
 * looked at what came back.
